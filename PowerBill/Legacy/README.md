# Legacy - PowerBill (PSeInt)

## Context
This is the original pseudocode implementation of the **PowerBill** project, developed in **PSeInt** during early programming courses.  
It represents the first version of the electricity billing system before being migrated and refactored into Java or other programming languages.

## Why Legacy? 
This version is kept as **legacy code** to show the original logic and structure in pseudocode. It contains the initial design, with its limitations and imperfections, serving as the foundation for later **refactored implementations** in Java and C++. 

## Next Steps 
- Refactor the logic into Java and C++ for real execution.
- Apply object-oriented design and modularity.
- Improve validation and error handling.
- Document the evolution from pseudocode to production-ready code.
