# PowerBill

The **Compañía de Fuerza y Luz (CFL)** provides electricity service to approximately 200,000 subscribers. Billing is a critical process that must be automated to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and transparency. The existing system does not meet operational needs, hence, a new system is critical.

The company needs a program capable of calculating and generating invoices for electricity consumption based on the following rules:

- **Fixed Service Fee:** Every subscriber pays a fixed fee of 5,400 colones.  
- **Consumption Charge:** Electricity usage is measured in kilowatt-volts (KWVs) and billed progressively according to a tiered rate table.  
- **Cruz Roja Tax:** An additional charge of 10 colones per KWV consumed is applied to support the Costa Rican Red Cross.  
- **Value Added Tax (VAT):** A 13% tax is applied to the consumption charge if the subscriber uses more than 25 KWVs.  

The system must process multiple clients, request their information (subscriber number, name, and monthly consumption), and generate a detailed invoice for each one. After processing all clients, the program should display a final report that includes:

- Total number of clients processed  
- Total KWVs consumed  
- Total fixed service fees  
- Total consumption charges  
- Total Cruz Roja tax  
- Total VAT collected  
- Total amount billed  
- Income tax owed by CFL, calculated as 10% of the sum of fixed service fees and consumption charges  

This project represents the migration of the original pseudocode solution (developed in PSeInt) into **Java**, applying structured programming and object-oriented principles to build a robust, maintainable, and efficient console application.
